### Overview
Welcome to the Reverse Engineering Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge!  
This challenge is designed to test and improve your reverse engineering skills.  
Analyze and dissect the provided binary to uncover hidden flags.

## Levels 📜
the levels difficulty

|level     |difficulty     | 
|:----------:|:-------------:| 
| 1 |  **easy**|

| 9 | **hard**|



## How to Play 🎓
#### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/PUXSY/Reverse-Engineering-CTF.git
```
#### 2.  Navigate to the project directory
```
cd Reverse-Engineering-CTF/Executables
```
#### 3.  Choose a challenge to start with
Run the RunMe_CTF.exe
```
RunMe_CTF.exe
```
And start a level when you find the flag go to RunMe_CTF.exe and chack if you are corect.
#### 4.  Use your favorite RE tools
Find all the flags!!!

> 💡 **Note:** On Windows, just double-click `RunMe_CTF.exe`. On Linux, ensure it has execute permissions (`chmod +x RunMe_CTF.exe`).

## Tools Needed 🔧
- Operating System: Windows or Linux
- Disassembler/Decompiler:  
  - [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/)  
  - [IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/)  
- Debugger:  
  - [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/)  
  - [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/)

## Hints and Tips 🚀
- **DO NOT** open `flags.json` to find the answers — that's cheating! 😉
- If you're stuck, check the `/src` folder. It contains the source code and helpful explanations.
- Flag format:  `CTF_level_{...}`
