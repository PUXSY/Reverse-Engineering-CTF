# Reverse Engineering CTF Challenge 🛠️

## Overview
Welcome to the Reverse Engineering Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge!  
This challenge is designed to test and improve your reverse engineering skills.  
Analyze and dissect the provided binary to uncover hidden flags.

## Levels 📜
the levels difficulty

|level     |difficulty     |
|:----------:|:-------------:|
| 1 |  easy  |
| 2 |  easy  |
| 3 |  easy  |
| 4 |  easy  |
| 5 | medium |
| 6 | medium |
| 7 | medium |
| 8 |  hard  |
| 9 |  hard  |



## How to Play 🎓
1. Navigate to the `/Executables` directory — it contains all the executable CTF files.
2. Run the main binary `./RunMe_CTF.exe`
3. Enter the flags as prompted. Each level corresponds to a unique reverse engineering task.
4. Use your reverse engineering tools and skills to solve each level.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate into the project folder: `cd Reverse-Engineering-CTF`
3. Go to the `Executables` directory: `cd Executables`
4. Run the main challenge binary: `./RunMe_CTF.exe`
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/PUXSY/Reverse-Engineering-CTF.git>
cd Reverse-Engineering-CTF
cd Executables
./RunMe_CTF.exe
```

> 💡 **Note:** On Windows, just double-click `RunMe_CTF.exe`. On Linux, ensure it has execute permissions (`chmod +x RunMe_CTF.exe`).

## Tools Needed 🔧
- Operating System: Windows or Linux
- Disassembler/Decompiler:  
  - [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/)  
  - [IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/)  
- Debugger:  
  - [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/)  
  - [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/)

## Hints and Tips 🚀
- **DO NOT** open `flags.json` to find the answers — that's cheating! 😉
- If you're stuck, check the `/src` folder. It contains the source code and helpful explanations.
- Flag format:  `CTF_level_{...}`
